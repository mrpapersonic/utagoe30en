□□ [Introduction] □□

"UTAGOE" is a program that attempts to render vocals alone by taking the difference between the master and karaoke tracks of a song.
In principle, it seems that complete vocals can be taken out easily by subtracting karaoke from the original, but in reality it is not that simple. Still, other options work pretty well, so give them a try.
A tool to create a WAV file from a CD is required, so please prepare it separately.
